Design Timeline

Week 5: Purchase components and assemble the sensor circuit, including the Arduino, onto the bike. 

Week 6: Write software to convert sensor data into speed shown on the LCD display. Test ride to ensure that everything is working properly.

Week 7: Fix any bugs or any errors with the existing project. Purchase any hardware components for the LED turn signals. Write software to include other trackers, such as the calorie counter and the total distance traveled. 

Week 8: Full test existing project during a test ride. Fix any bugs or any errors with the existing project. Assemble hardware add-ons such as LED turn and brake lights.  

Week 9: Finish assembling hardware add-ons. Final test and error-fixing of the project. 

Tasks to do:
1. solder the breadboard
2. CHECK UNITS OF THE MATH CONVERSIONS, speed might be in meters....

11/16: can print output onto the LCD based on given sensor data. Haven't attached to bike yet.
